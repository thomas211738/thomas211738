### ML on Technical Analysis Indicators
As a lead quantitative developer, I'm involved in BU's Finance and Investments Club, specifically their quantitative division. I'm currently leading a team of 4 quantitative developers to create many technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger bands, etc.) in Python to be used on S&P 500 stocks. We then utilize machine learning in TensorFlow on the different technical analysis indicators to find patterns between them and predict the future directionality of a stock using the past 90 days. This project will then be used to help choose stocks to invest in using the club‚Äôs management fund (~1.1M AUM). Learn more about this project below!

### Sentiment Driven Stock Selector

I wanted to see if there was a correlation between news headlines and stock prices. I used Python to scrape Google News for S&P 500 companies‚Äô headlines. I then analyzed the average sentiment of 5 headlines for each company daily for 4 weeks using the NLTK library. Applied linear regression to the data to identify the correlation between a company‚Äôs sentiment score and stock profit as a percentage of a company. Learn more about this project below!

### Portfolio Website

@joshleeds and I created a portfolio website for ourselves over the summer with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Working together as a team, we were able to create a website that showcased our coding skills and designs. We coded advanced animations, including a parallax scrolling effect, which created an engaging user experience. We also hosted the website using GitHub Pages and even created a domain for it. Learn more about this project below!
